print "Expelliarmus"  # Almost beautiful in its simplicity, the Disarming Charm is frequently used 
					  # in wizarding duels, forcing one's opponent to drop their wand.
					  #	As soon as a wizard casts this charm by bellowing 'Expelliarmus',
					  #	a jet of red light shoots from their wand. Harry has the members of Dumbledore's 
					  #	Army practise the spell in pairs.
